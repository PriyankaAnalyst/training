**********************************************************
Prepare rules for the all the data sets  - Books and Movies Dataset
1) Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulize the obtained rules using different plots
